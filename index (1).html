    <h1> My Models </h1>
    <p> I've been modelling since 2019.  From there, I made more models, from small die-cast models to a TVS (Television Series) accurate cardboard model. I'll showcase some of those models in this page.</p>
    <h2> TVS Engines </h2>
    <h3> Thomas </h3>
    <img src="IMG_6405.JPG" alt="TVS Thomas" width="400" height="309">
    <p> Thomas started in 2019 when I found him in the bottom of my old toy bin. He had the 2009 body with the 2006 face and wheels. Then in 2021, I gave him a white running board and LEGO lamp. I removed that at the beginning of this year. Then, I gave him more faces which you can't see. Last month, I gave him a black base. </p>
    <h3> Gordon </h3>
    <img src="IMG_6395.JPG" alt="TVS Gordon and Thomas" width="400" height="309">
    <p> I started Gordon early this year, when I did some touch ups on his buffers. Then around July, I painted a face for him and made a custom wheelset. </p>

    <p> I used wheels from a Minis Gordon and used red electrical tape to attach them to the chassis block </p>
    <h2 id="percy"> The Percys </h2>
    <h3 id="percy"> Sodor Fallout Percy </h3>
    <img id="percy" src="IMG_6432.JPG" alt="Broken Jaw Percy" width="400" height="309">
    <p id="percy"> Sodor Fallout Percy is a unique one as he is only a body and has a modified clay face.  I finished him yesterday and also took some shots of him and is based off of this. </p>

    <h3 id="percy"> DOWT UK Percy </h3>
    <img src="unknown_20.png" alt="dowt uk percy" width="400" height="309">
    <p id="percy"> This is a planned project I have to make a Trackmaster model of this engine used for the Day Out with Thomas events in the U.K. </p>
    <h2 id="percy"> The Many Thomases </h2>
    <h3 id="percy"> Alternate Universe Thomas </h3>
    <img src="IMG_6431.JPG" alt="AU Thomas shell" width="400" height="309">
    <p id="percy"> I used Apple Barrel Matte Black and Colbalt blue to paint the shell. It is made to fit my custom clay faces.</p>
    <h3> J50 Thomas </h3>
    <img src="IMG_6430.JPG" alt="J50 Thomas" width="400" height="309">
    <p> This version of Thomas is based off of the original design for Thomas which was a LNER J50. I used a Tomy Rosie that was heavily modified to fit the basis. I chopped off the funnel, and two of the thin domes. Then, my dad used a lighter to melt the the funnel onto the engine. Like before, I used the Apple Barrel paint I had to paint him. I then used a old Percy chassis (from the Sodor Fallout Percy). I repainted it, took a middle wheel from my old Tomy James, and painted it all blue. I masked the edges of the footplate and gave it a coat of black. After that, I started on the faces. I made 3 faces: shocked, happy, and sad. For all of them I referenced the Reginald Dalby illustrations. A few weeks ago, with a lot I got, I replaced the siderods with ones from a Tomy Spencer. As of now, he does not run. </p>
    <h2> Thomas the Chav Engine Models </h2>
    <p> Thomas the Chav Engine is a parody of Thomas aired on TV and now on Youtube. Those models were made using generic Christmas engines which custom clay faces. I plan on getting one of those to make a Thomas replica. </p>
    <h3> Roblox </h3>
    <img src="RobloxScreenShot20221018_181457546.png" alt="Roblox Chav (Thomas) and Special Coal (Henry)" width="400" height="290">
    <p> I made these guys in Roblox for a game I'm doing which is in the style of old 2009 Roblox games. Part of this 2009 Parody is that the names are different, which you can see here. </p>
    <h2> LEGO </h2>
    <h3> Hudswell Clarke 1800 0-6-0ST </h3>
    <img src="IMG_6409.JPG" alt="Hudswell Clarke 1800 0-6-0ST " width="400" height="309">
    <p> There is only one of this class and is preserved wearing this blue livery.I made this using off-brand LEGOs I got from my dollar store, the Gas Station Fire set, and the Christmas train set. I built him in sections. </p>
